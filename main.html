        <h1>The Walkman</h1>

        <h2 id="cap1">Purpose of use</h2>
        <p>
            The Walkman is a brand of portable media players.
            It was a portable cassette player that changed listening habits by allowing people 
            to listen to music of their choice on the move.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap2">The cost</h2>
        <p>
            After a development phase of only four months, Sony engineers had a reliable product 
            ready for market at 30,000 Yen (approximately $150 in 1979 dollars) and available 
            before the start of the summer vacation for Japanese students.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap3">Its popularity</h2>
        <p>
            The initial production run of 30,000 units looked to be too ambitious after the first 
            month of lackluster sales (only 3,000 were sold in July 1979).
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap4">The users</h2>
        <p>
            Being invented at the end of the 1970s the walkman was used by the 70s and 80s teens.
            This does not mean that older people couldn’t use it.

        </p>
        <h2 id="cap5">Frequency</h2>
        <p>
            This device was for sure used a lot while going outside to hang out 
            with friends or during the trip to go to school. <br>
            Picture representing the users. Walkman’s battery last, while used a lot, from 
            eight to ten hours even thought it was meant to last forty hours as Sony advertised, 
            but at the same time those hours were enough to listen to music at home and outside.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap6">The style</h2>
        <p>
            The Sony’ s walkman was a blue and white box with a little window in 
            the middle through which you could see the cassette type. On the white side 
            there were some buttons which allowed you to skip ahead, stop or skip backwards. 
            At the top there were the 2 jack type connectors for the little 
            headphones provided with the device.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap7">Creation and release date</h2>
        <p>
            The word is also a brand; the first specimen was sold on 1st July 1979. A German 
            inventor, Andreas Pavel, in 1980 claimed to be the real inventor, given that two years 
            earlier he had created a very similar object, calling it stereobelt. 
            After several legal proceedings in 1999 Sony and Pavel reached an out-of-court settlement.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap8">What kind of technology was used?</h2>
        <p>
            Starting from July 1, 1979 it was discovered that every man was given the 
            prerogative to transform his life into a film, choosing the soundtrack and 
            customizing the rhythm. Until then, the only instrument capable of transmitting 
            music outside was the portable radio, and the arrival of the Walkman irreversibly 
            changed the way we approached music; it had two headphone jacks and a hotline 
            facility to allow language over a microphone.
        </p>
        <h2 id="cap9">The device these days.</h2>
        <p>
            These days the walkman has been replaced by the mp3 player, later in the years by 
            the mp4 player and the Ipod and even later by the smartphones.
            So let’s compare these devices:
            The MP3 was a really little device used like the walkman to listen to music 
            when outside in a comfortable and private way. In fact with all these music 
            players you could choose to listen to some songs by headphones or a speaker.
            The MP4 was a bit bigger because it used a screen to select and watch music
            videos while listening to them. In fact the name MP4 such as MP3 came from the extensions 
            used for PC files as music (MP3) and videos (MP4).
            And after this one the Ipod touch came, a really advanced MP4 made from Apple Inc. 
            a really important and famous tech industry that made and published a lot of technologies 
            such as the mouse and the smartphone or even the portable computer.
            This device was the closest thing to a smartphone, with a touchscreen, 1 headphone jack, 
            1 recharge cable and some buttons to low or rise the music volume and the famous HOME button.
            After seeing all the similarities the Iphone has with the Ipod the idea to put the 
            function to listen to music on the phone came naturally.

        <h2 id="cap10">Common think about Walkman</h2>
        <p>
            I: mum what do you think about the walkman? <br>
            Mum: when I was a child it wasn't very popular, but later when I grew up 
            it became very common and almost everyone had one. <br>
            I: did you have one too? <br>
            Mum: of course. <br>
            I: and you dad? <br>
            Dad: obviously <br>
